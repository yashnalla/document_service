# Document Service: Modern SaaS Architecture Overview

---

## Architecture & Infra

- **Compute:** Django ASGI app (serving HTTP & WebSocket) runs in Docker containers, deployed on any container based cloud provider service for orchestration and rolling updates.  
  _Why:_ ASGI enables real-time collaboration; containers provide portability, isolation and ease of scaling.
- **Storage:**  
  - **PostgreSQL:** Durable document, user, and audit data; GIN inverted index for full-text search.
  - **Redis:** In-memory cache, WebSocket channel layer, and real-time user presence.
  _Best Practice:_ Durable DB for state, Redis for ephemeral/collaboration state.
- **Caching:**  
  - Redis used for session/cache and pub/sub events for collaboration and UI presence.
---

## CI/CD & Deployment

- **Pipelines:** GitHub Actions automates lint/test/build, then pushes Docker images to registry. Automates multiple deployment stages
- **Deployment:** multiple stages, blue/green and/r canary for safe rollout.
- **Rollback:** Automated rollback on failed health checks/canary error rate/integration test failures.

---

## Security & Compliance

- **Auth:** SSO/OAuth2 (via Django-allauth); per-user and per-document permissions enforced in service layer.
- **Encryption:** TLS for all network traffic; PostgreSQL encryption at rest.
- **Audit Logs:** All doc changes and user actions tracked for forensic/audit purposes.
- **Compliance:** Data deletion/right-to-be-forgotten (GDPR); access controls and audit (SOC2).
- _Best Practice:_ Centralize auth, encrypt everything, log all changes; necessary for multi-tenant, collaborative SaaS.

## Scalability & Resilience

### Scalability

**Goal:** Handle more users, documents, and real-time edits without performance drops.

#### 1. Stateless Web App Containers

* **Horizontal scaling:**
  * The Django ASGI app is stateless, so you can run multiple web containers.
  * Load balancer (NGINX, ALB, etc.) distributes requests and WebSocket connections across containers.
* **Benefits:**
  * You can add/remove containers based on demand (autoscaling).
  * If one container fails, others keep serving requests—no single point of failure.

#### 2. Redis Scaling

* Redis handles ephemeral state: presence, real-time events, channel layers.
* **Redis Cluster or Sentinel:**
  * Redis Sentinel provides failover and monitoring for high availability.
  * Redis Cluster allows sharding for very large datasets ( very rare for our use-case, but nonetheless) and/or deployments.
* **Benefits:**
  * Real-time collaboration remains fast and available even if a Redis node fails (with Sentinel).

#### 3. Database Scaling

* **Vertical scaling:**
  * Increase CPU/RAM on the PostgreSQL server as traffic grows.
* **Read replicas:**
  * For heavy read/search workloads, use PostgreSQL read replicas to offload queries without impacting writes.
* **Connection Pooling:**
  * Use PgBouncer/ProxySQL to manage database connections efficiently.
* **Trade-off:**
  * Writes must go to the primary DB; scaling writes horizontally is difficult. For most document collaboration, reads outnumber writes.

#### 4. Batch Processing

* For expensive operations (updating search vectors, audit log aggregation), use background workers (Celery, Django-Q, or Kubernetes Jobs).
* **Benefits:**
  * Keeps main app responsive; expensive tasks don't block real-time editing.

### Resilience & Failover

**Goal:** Survive crashes, outages, or maintenance with minimal user impact.

#### 1. Web Container Failover

* **Stateless design:**
  * If a container is killed/restarted, user sessions and edits continue through other containers.
* **Health checks:**
  * Orchestrator auto-restarts unhealthy containers.
* **Zero downtime deploys:**
  * Rolling updates or blue/green deployments keep some containers live during upgrades.

#### 2. Redis Failover

* **Sentinel/Cluster:**
  * Automatically promotes a replica to master if the current master fails.
* **Session recovery:**
  * Presence/channel state may be briefly interrupted but can recover quickly.
* **Trade-off:**
  * Redis data is mostly ephemeral; if lost, only user presence and in-flight messages are impacted (not documents themselves).

#### 3. Database Failover

* **Multi-zone or managed DB:**
  * Use cloud DB services (AWS RDS, Cloud SQL) with automatic failover to standby in another zone.
* **Backups:**
  * Regular, automated backups for disaster recovery.
* **Read replica promotion:**
  * If primary fails, promote a replica to primary. Some downtime, but recoverable.

## Monitoring & Observability

- **Metrics:** Prometheus collects infra/app metrics; Grafana dashboards for real-time ops.
- **Logs:** Centralized logging plus granular audit logs for compliance and troubleshooting.
- **Tracing:** OpenTelemetry integration for distributed tracing of user actions and system flows.
- **Alerts:** Automated notifications on errors, latency, or resource spikes.
- _Best Practice:_ SaaS platforms must detect issues quickly—deep observability minimizes MTTR and meets service SLAs.

---

## Operations & Cost Management

- **Cost Controls:** Use autoscaling, right-size containers, spot/preemptible instances where possible.
- **Multi-region:** Active-passive DB, geo-replicated Redis, DNS failover for HA.
- **Right-sizing:** Continuous monitoring and review of usage/data; prune unused data, optimize query/index usage.
- _Trade-off:_ Multi-region and HA increase cost/complexity but are critical for uptime and global reach.

### **Summary & Priorities**

- **Why these choices:**  
  - Durable DB and in-memory cache balance reliability and speed for collaborative editing.
  - CI/CD and observability drive rapid iteration and high uptime.
  - Security/compliance are foundational for user trust and enterprise adoption.
  - Scalability and cost controls allow for efficient growth and sustainable ops.

- **Best Practice for Document Collaboration SaaS:**  
  - Secure, observable, and resilient core.
  - Design for scale (horizontal where possible), but avoid unnecessary complexity.
  - Optimize infra for cost and compliance.
